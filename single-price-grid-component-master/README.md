## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge is pretty straightforward for me. However, the only hiccup I faced is which heading level to use for the text. I thought about using heading 1 for the "Join our community" and heading 2 for the rest of the section header, but I don't feel it will produce a sensible heading level. So, I decided to use heading 2 for all section headers and used a hidden heading 1.

### Continued development

This project made me realize, that semantics HTML and accessibility is a big topic to tackle. I will probably still have difficulities selecting the right sematic tags until the foreseeeable future.
