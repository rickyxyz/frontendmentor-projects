## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"[Field Name] cannot be empty"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Looks like this is not an email"_

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Preprocessor

### What I learned

The HTML and CSS in this challenge is quite straightforward for me at this point.
The only things that caused me to slow down a little bit is how to do the form validation with as little repetition as possible.
Sure I can just write a lot of if statement for the validation to validate all the inputs, but I think that approach is cumbersome
and will make the code less maintainable and expandable. So, I searched the internet on how to do the form validation as best as possible.
The I found this YouTube video [The BEST way to do form validation in JavaScript](https://youtu.be/iyngFd6f8ko) on how to do the form validation.
Most of the code in my JS file is from the video above or a modified version of it 😊.

### Continued development

For the future, I would like to improve my JS skills. Especially things that are related to user inputs on the webpage.
