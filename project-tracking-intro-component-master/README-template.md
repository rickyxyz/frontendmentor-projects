## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### Accessibility & ARIA attribute usage.

For this project, I tried to focus on learning accessibility and ARIA attributes.

Tried HTML new popover API
Take care of the "in-between" states too

### Continued development

Look into more modern CSS selector
Look into CSS positioning techniques
Look into more ARIA attributes

### Useful resources

- [Frontend Mentor: Introduction to web accessibility](https://www.frontendmentor.io/learning-paths/introduction-to-web-accessibility-mXu-9PHVsd) - This Frontend Mentor learning path is where I look for most of the links for web accessibility.
- [CSS Popover + Anchor Positioning is Magical (Video by Kevin Powell)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNXEORSk4GU) - This is where I learned how to use the popover API.
