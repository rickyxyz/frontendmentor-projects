### What I learned

Been a while since I did a FrontendMentor challenge, some of my skills seemed to have lowered a bit. But, here is what I've learned/re-learned from doing this project:

- Add a div inside a section to control its width. You don't want a section's content to fill out the entire screen width, especially on widescreen so you need to limit it somehow.
- CSS works a bit differently in React, since with React its easy to toggle the rendering of element so CSS need to account for that.
- TailwindCSS is a bit annoying to setup at first especially for smaller project, so I don't think it is worth it to use Tailwind on single page project like FrontendMentor project. But using Tailwind is definitely worth it on larger multi-page project.
- After so long not using SCSS and going back to CSS, I can now definitely see the advantages of using SCSS.
- A bit rusty, but should've looked at both the mobile and desktop design more closely before making the code to determine the best HTML structure.

### Continued development

After a long time not doing FrontendMentor challenge, I think I should start looking more seriously into aria labels and accessibility related things.
